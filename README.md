End-to-end ML pipeline with image preprocessing and prediction.

###  * Job Market Analysis Tool *
 What it does: Data-driven analysis of the tech job market — extracting insights on in-demand skills, salary trends, geographic distribution of roles, and more. 
How it works: Uses Python for data processing, NLP (spaCy / NLTK) to extract technical skills from job descriptions, clustering & ML (scikit-learn) to group roles. 

Interface: Built a Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualizations. 

Future goals:
Add real-time job scraping from platforms like Bayt.com (Middle East-focused) 
Build a salary prediction model
Expand analysis to compare regional vs. global job markets
